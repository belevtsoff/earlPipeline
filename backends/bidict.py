Overview

``bidict`` provides a bidirectional mapping data structure and related
utilities (``namedbidict``, ``inverted``) to naturally model one-to-one
relations in Python. To keep the learning curve low, it introduces no new
functions to the ``dict`` API you're already familiar with. It owes its
simplicity to Python's slice syntax, which provides a handy and natural way
of expressing the inverse mapping in a ``bidict``::
    
    >>> husbands2wives = bidict({'john': 'jackie'})
    >>> husbands2wives['john'] # the forward mapping is just like with dict
    'jackie'
    >>> husbands2wives[:'jackie'] # use slice for the inverse mapping
    'john'

You can also use the unary inverse operator ``~`` on a bidict to get the
inverse mapping::

    >>> ~husbands2wives
    bidict({'jackie': 'john'})


--------------------------
Motivation & More Examples
--------------------------

Python's built-in ``dict`` lets us associate unique keys with arbitrary values.
Because keys must be hashable, values can be looked up by key in constant time.
Different keys can map to the same value, but a single key cannot map to two
different values. For instance, ``{-1: 1, 0: 0, 1: 1}`` is a ``dict`` with
three unique keys and two unique values, because the keys -1 and 1 both map to
1. If you try to write its inverse ``{1: -1, 0: 0, 1: 1}``, the ``dict`` that
comes out has only two mappings, one for key 1 and one for key 0; since key 1
is not allowed to map to both -1 and 1, one of these mappings is discarded.

Sometimes the relation we're modeling will only ever have a single key mapping
to a single value, as in the relation of husbands to wives (assuming monogamy).
This is called a one-to-one (or injective) mapping (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_mapping).

In this case we can be sure that the inverse mapping has the same number of
items as the forward mapping, and moreover that if key k maps to value v in the
forward mapping, value v maps to key k in the inverse. It would be useful then
to be able to look up keys by value in constant time in addition to being able
to look up values by key. With the additional constraint that values must be
hashable as well as keys, just such a bidirectional dictionary is possible:
enter ``bidict``.

``bidict`` provides a bidirectional mapping data structure which offers
constant-time forward and inverse lookups in a syntax which builds naturally
on what we're already used to from regular dicts. Consider the following
one-to-one mapping::

    >>> h2w = bidict({'bill': 'hillary', 'barack': 'michelle'})

To look up a wife by husband, use the familiar subscript syntax as with a dict::

    >>> h2w['bill']
    'hillary'

Or, by analogy to array slicing, you can optionally provide a trailing colon to
emphasize that you're talking about a forward mapping::

    >>> h2w['bill':]
    'hillary'

And now you can guess how to spell the inverse mapping (i.e. to look up a
husband by wife)::

    >>> h2w[:'hillary']
    'bill'

The slice syntax works for setting and deleting items in either direction too::

    >>> h2w['bill':] = 'melinda'
    >>> h2w[:'cher'] = 'sonny'
    >>> del h2w[:'michelle']

The ``namedbidict`` class factory can be used to create a bidirectional mapping
with customized names for the forward and the inverse mappings accessible via
attributes.

A real-world example can be found in the ``htmlentitydefs`` module, which
maintains a ``name2codepoint`` dict and an inverse ``codepoint2name`` dict
separately. This could instead be modeled with a single ``bidict``::

    >>> HTMLEntities = namedbidict('HTMLEntities', 'names', 'codepoints')
    >>> entities = HTMLEntities({'lt': 60, 'gt': 62, 'amp': 38}) # etc
    >>> entities.names['lt']
    60
    >>> entities.codepoints[38]
    'amp'

See the ``bidict`` class for more examples.

Note: ``bidict`` does not subclass ``dict``, but its API is a superset of the
``dict`` API minus the ``fromkeys`` method, which does not make sense in the
context of an injective mapping. ``bidict`` implements the ``MutableMapping``
interface.

This module also provides an ``inverted`` iterator in the spirit of the built-in
``reversed``. Pass in a mapping to get the inverse mapping, an iterable of pairs
to get the pairs' inverses, or any object implementing an ``__inverted__``
method. See the ``inverted`` class for examples.

Note: "inverse" rather than "reverse" is used because it's the term used in
mathematics and its meaning is more specific, and because "reversed" already
means something different in Python (reversing the order of the items in a
sequence versus inverting the (k, v) pairs in a mapping).

"""

import re
from collections import MutableMapping
from functools import wraps

class inverted(object):
    """
    An iterator in the spirit of ``reversed``. Useful for inverting a mapping::

        >>> keys = (1, 2, 3)
        >>> vals = ('one', 'two', 'three')
        >>> fwd = dict(zip(keys, vals))
        >>> inv = dict(inverted(fwd))
        >>> inv == dict(zip(vals, keys))
        True

    Passing an iterable of pairs produces an iterable of the pairs' inverses::
        
        >>> seq = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]
        >>> list(inverted(seq))
        [('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3)]

    Under the covers, ``inverted`` first tries to call ``__inverted__`` on the
    wrapped object and returns an iterator over the result if the call
    succeeds. If the call fails, ``inverted`` next tries to call ``items`` on
    the wrapped object, returning the inverses of the resulting pairs if the
    call succeeds. Finally, if the ``items`` call fails, ``inverted`` falls
    back on unpacking pairs from the wrapped object directly.

    This allows for passing an ``inverted`` object back into ``inverted`` to
    to get the original sequence of pairs back out::

        >>> seq == list(inverted(inverted(seq)))
        True

    Be careful with passing the inverse of a non-injective mapping into
    ``dict``; mappings for like values with differing keys will be lost:: 

        >>> squares = {-2: 4, -1: 1, 0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4}
        >>> len(squares)
        5
        >>> len(dict(inverted(squares)))
        3

class bidict(object):
    """
    Bidirectional mapping implementing the ``MutableMapping`` interface, with
    additional facilities for retrieving inverse mappings. The API is a
    superset of the ``dict`` API (minus the ``fromkeys`` method, which doesn't
    make sense for a bidirectional mapping because keys *and* values must be
    unique).

    To demonstrate::

        >>> keys = (1, 2, 3)
        >>> vals = ('one', 'two', 'three')
        >>> bi = bidict(zip(keys, vals))
        >>> bi == bidict({1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'})
        True
        >>> bidict(inverted(bi)) == bidict(zip(vals, keys))
        True

    You can use standard subscripting syntax with a key to get or set a forward
    mapping::

        >>> bi[2]
        'two'
        >>> bi[2] = 'twain'
        >>> bi[2]
        'twain'
        >>> bi[4]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        KeyError: 4

    Or use a slice with only a ``start``::

        >>> bi[2:]
        'twain'
        >>> bi[0:] = 'naught'
        >>> bi[0:]
        'naught'

    Use a slice with only a ``stop`` to get or set an inverse mapping::

        >>> bi[:'one']
        1
        >>> bi[:'aught'] = 1
        >>> bi[:'aught']
        1
        >>> bi[1]
        'aught'
        >>> bi[:'one']
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        KeyError: 'one'

    Deleting items from the bidict works the same way::

        >>> del bi[0]
        >>> del bi[2:]
        >>> del bi[:'three']
        >>> bi
        bidict({1: 'aught'})

    ``bidict``s maintain references to their inverses via the ``inv`` property,
    which can also be used to access or modify them::

        >>> bi.inv
        bidict({'aught': 1})
        >>> bi.inv['aught']
        1
        >>> bi.inv[:1]
        'aught'
        >>> bi.inv[:1] = 'one'
        >>> bi.inv
        bidict({'one': 1})
        >>> bi
        bidict({1: 'one'})
        >>> bi.inv.inv is bi
        True
        >>> bi.inv.inv.inv is bi.inv
        True

    A ``bidict``'s inverse can also be accessed via the unary ~ operator, by
    analogy to the unary bitwise inverse operator::

        >>> ~bi
        bidict({'one': 1})
        >>> ~bi is bi.inv
        True

    Because ~ binds less tightly than brackets, parentheses are necessary for
    something like::
        
        >>> (~bi)['one']
        1
    
    ``bidict``s work with ``inverted`` as expected::

        >>> biinv = bidict(inverted(bi))
        >>> biinv
        bidict({'one': 1})

    This of course creates a new object (equivalent but not identical)::
        
        >>> biinv == bi.inv
        True
        >>> biinv is bi.inv
        False

    This just demonstrated that ``__eq__`` has been implemented to work as
    expected. ``__neq__`` has too::

        >>> bi != biinv
        True
    
    ``bidict``s should compare as expected to instances of other mapping types::

        >>> bi == dict([(1, 'one')])
        True

    Inverting the inverse should round trip::

        >>> bi == bidict(inverted(inverted(bi)))
        True

    Use ``invert`` to invert the mapping in place::

        >>> bi.invert()
        >>> bi
        bidict({'one': 1})

    The rest of the MutableMapping interface is supported too::

        >>> bi.get('one')
        1
        >>> bi.setdefault('one', 2)
        1
        >>> bi.setdefault('two', 2)
        2
        >>> len(bi) # calls __len__
        2
        >>> bi.pop('one')
        1
        >>> bi.popitem()
        ('two', 2)
        >>> bi.inv.setdefault(3, 'three')
        'three'
        >>> bi
        bidict({'three': 3})
        >>> [key for key in bi] # calls __iter__, returns keys like dict
        ['three']
        >>> 'three' in bi # calls __contains__
        True
        >>> list(bi.keys())
        ['three']
        >>> list(bi.values())
        [3]
        >>> bi.update([('four', 4)])
        >>> bi.update({'five': 5}, six=6, seven=7)
        >>> sorted(bi.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
        [('three', 3), ('four', 4), ('five', 5), ('six', 6), ('seven', 7)]

    When instantiating or updating a ``bidict``, remember that mappings for
    like values with differing keys will be lost, otherwise the map would not
    be bidirectional::

        >>> nil = bidict({'zero': 0, 'zilch': 0, 'zip': 0})
        >>> len(nil)
        1
        >>> nil.update(nix=0, nada=0)
        >>> len(nil)
        1

    One other gotcha: when mapping the key of one existing mapping to the value
    of another (or vice versa), the two mappings collapse into one::

        >>> b = bidict({1: 'one', 2: 'two'})
        >>> b[1] = 'two'
        >>> b
        bidict({1: 'two'})
        >>> b = bidict({1: 'one', 2: 'two'})
        >>> b[:'two'] = 1
        >>> b
        bidict({1: 'two'})
